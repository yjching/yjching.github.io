You're the greatest thing that has ever been or ever will be. You're special. You're so very special. Just make little strokes like that. You can create the world you want to see and be a part of. You have that power. And I know you're saying, 'Oh Bob, you've done it this time.' And you may be right.

### Happy trees!

The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. There's not a thing in the world wrong with washing your brush. That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. Let that brush dance around there and play.
